# Frontend Mentor - Devjobs web app

This is a Frontend Mentor project at advanced level.

I used Sass and JavaScript for coding this project. All of the code is from my self.

This is my first big project using Sass so it's not perfect. Also my JS for filter is not the perfect way I think. I need to find a better way.

I learned a lot about Sass and JS while doing this project
